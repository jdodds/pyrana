Pyrana -- a minimalist music player.

This program was written out of frustration with larger music players. Pretty
much all I've ever wanted out of a music player was one that played random
albums by picking a random artist, then picking a random album, then playing
that album, then picking _another random artist_.

For some reason,I've never run into a music player that played random albums
that way, which led to me often ending up having to skip past multiple albums by
a particular artist, especially when the artist has a large discography. 

While I call this player minimalist, that's not set in stone -- I'll probably
add last.fm scrobbling capability and other various features. These features
will, however, be ones that I find useful. I highly doubt this app will ever be
incredibly bloated.
