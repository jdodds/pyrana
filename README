Pyrana -- a minimalist music player.

This program was written out of frustration with larger music players. Pretty
much all I've ever wanted out of a music player was one that played random
albums by picking a random artist, then picking a random album, then playing
that album, then picking _another random artist_.

For some reason,I've never run into a music player that played random albums
that way, which led to me often ending up having to skip past multiple Frank
Zappa albums when playing random albums. I like Zappa, but not that goddamned
much. Same deal with Slayer and Aphex Twin and Bad Religion, and all these other
artists and bands that I have discographies of.

Another problem I've had is that a lot of 'modern' music players base their
artist and album information off of metadata. I have a couple of issues with
this:

1: My music collection is large. Doing a scan of metadata, even if it only needs
to be done once takes a long time. I hate it.

2: My music collection has unreliable metadata. This is because I'm a lazy
asshole, and haven't kept up with fixing metadata on music that I
download. That's right, I download music -- so do you, shut up. My music
collection is so large that the probability of me fixing the metadata ever is
basically nil. I can, however, rely on the directory structure of my music
collection.

This little program does one thing, and does it acceptably -- play random albums
from a music collection. Maybe it'll expand in the future to include things like
last.fm support. Maybe.
