Pyrana -- A minimalist music player.
====================================

ABOUT
-----

This program was written out of frustration with larger music players. Pretty
much all I've ever wanted out of a music player was one that played random
albums by picking a random artist, then picking a random album, then playing
that album, then picking another random artist.

For some reason,I've never run into a music player that played random albums
that way, which led to me often ending up having to skip past multiple albums by
a particular artist, especially when the artist has a large discography.

While I call this player minimalist, that's not set in stone -- I'll probably
add last.fm scrobbling capability and other various features. These features
will, however, be ones that I find useful. I highly doubt this app will ever be
incredibly bloated.

REQUIREMENTS
------------

Pyrana WILL NOT WORK if you do not install what is outlined below.

You'll need PyGTK, available from http://www.pygtk.org/downloads.html . (last
version I teseted on was 2.22 ) Its setup.py throws a big old warning if you try
to install it via setuputils, and I've never actually had it successfully
install that way. On the plus side, your package manager probably provides a
package, if it's not already on your system.

You'll also need to install python-notify >= 1.1, available from
http://www.galago-project.org/files/releases/source/notify-python/ . I'll
probably try to move away from this dependency in the near future.

ALSO, you'll need to install gst-python >= 0.10.0, available from
http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/src/gst-python/ . This is another dependency
I'll be most likely removing at some point...

Your music directory has to be arranged in a artist/album heirarchy. Something like:

music/
  Underpowered Umpires/
    Third Strike/
  Robby and the Revoltors/
    William S. Burroughs Was My Father/

CONFIGURING
-----------

Pyrana stores its configuration in ~/.pyrana/pyrana.cfg. It currently accepts 3
options:

use_notify :: whether or not to use libnotify to pop up little messages about
what's playing, defaults to True

music_dir :: where your music is located, defaults to ~/music

update_pidgin_status :: whether you want Pyrana to update your pidgin status for
you when a track updates, defaults to True
